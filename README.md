# po_project
A straightforward window application in Java designed for quick note-taking. This project was undertaken to fulfil a university subject requirement. While it has its limitations, I'm currently focusing on other projects, and po_project has served its primary purpose.


# Features
- **Login**: Secure your notes with a simple login mechanism.
- **Add & Delete Notes**: Write and remove your notes as needed.
